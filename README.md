Using Kernel PCA using different kernel like gaussian, polynomial, sigmoid, linear and laplacian kernel

# Data
Meter B contains 92 instances of diagnostic parameters for a 4-path liquid USM. It has 52 attributes and 3 classes: 
  Class '1' - Healthy 
  Class '2' - Gas injection 
  Class '3' - Waxing
  

(1) -- Profile factor 

(2) -- Symmetry 

(3) -- Crossflow 

(4) -- Swirl angle 

(5)-(8) -- Flow velocity in each of the four paths 
(9) -- Average flow velocity in all four paths 
(10)-(13) -- Speed of sound in each of the four paths 
(14) -- Average speed of sound in all four paths 
(15)-(22) -- Signal strength at both ends of each of the four paths 
(23)-(26) -- Turbulence in each of the four paths 
(27) -- Meter performance 
(28)-(35) -- Signal quality at both ends of each of the four paths 
(36)-(43) -- Gain at both ends of each of the four paths 
(44)-51 -- Transit time at both ends of each of the four paths 
(52) -- Class attribute or health state of meter: 1,2,3
